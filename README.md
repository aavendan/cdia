The major problem is to develop a method which works exactly the way how a human brain works. The architecture of artificial intelligence must emphasize on evaluation and redesign the nature of design process. Data science is also trending now and analytically deals to solve complex problems. Data is divided into smaller parts and its trends, behaviors are understood. The main problem in data science is to handle large quantities of data. Though there is significant increase in terms of research opportunities few challenges like lack of compute power, people power still remains a big challenge. keywords: {Deep learning;Data science;Hardware;Graphics processing units;Conferences;Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Data science and Data Analytics},URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8653670&isnumber=8653599
